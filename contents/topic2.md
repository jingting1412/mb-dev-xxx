### SOCcat

It sounds adorable but I've never seen it like anywhere. Seems like a missed marketing opportunity for SoC honestly.

### LiNUS

Looks so goofy. I love watching the mascot walking around during open house tho you can clearly
tell the guy wearing it is having the best time of their life.
