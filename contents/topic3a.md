# The chickens

I live in RVRC, so I frequently see/hear the chickens. Really want to just cook one because they
look so fat. The chicks are really cute tho I see them sometimes following their mom around.

  Their range of movement is really wide! From RV to Central Library to FASS and all the way to Utown. Amazing!

  Did you know that with their population boom the greatest threat isnt inbreeding? But 
  breeding with domestic chickens. The ones commonly found in NUS are Red Junglefowls, but there
  are more and more domestic chickens that also roam the streets and breed with them, decreasing the number of pure Red Junglefowls.
