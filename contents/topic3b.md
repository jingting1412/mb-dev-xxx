# The jungle that is RVRC

RVRC is near the ridge so there's a lot of animals here. From otters to monitor lizards to snakes and to monkeys that are sighted for the first time in Singapore, we have everything here.

Here are some of the animals that I've seen / have been sighted in RV:

- otters (10/10 would welcome)
- monitor lizard (0/10 nope nope nope)
- painted bronzeback (3/10 would admire but please dont come into my room you danger shoelace)
- puffin, the stray dog in NUS
- Silvered Langur - [first such sighting in Singapore](https://mothership.sg/2023/09/silvered-langur-clementi/)
