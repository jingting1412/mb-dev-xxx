### Putu
> Younger than Plum and I've only seen her once :cry: but I love her already. Another torty I think. She is getting CHONKY and has a lot of personality. I wanna see her more.

<box type="info">
  I love photos of Putu sleeping. I aspire to be like Putu always, just chillin and looking for food.

### Belle

Another old madame! She's so small I'm always so shocked by how small she is like she's
just a little black mass outside LT27 area. Gives off huge batman vibes. Wouldn't dare to touch her.

<box no-background type="info" icon="ðŸ§¬">

Did you know that Belle had 4 kittens called A, C, T, G? Adorable.
