# The cats in NUS

### Plum
I love plum so much like she is so small and fluffy whenever I see her at Utown it makes my day.
10/10 cat. Also allows people to pet her and has an iconic chicken leg sitting position. We love
an icon. ðŸ‘‘ðŸ‘‘ðŸ‘‘:crown::crown:

### Putu
Younger than Plum and I've only seen her once :cry: but I love her already. Another torty I think
Is getting CHONKY and has a lot of personality. I wanna see her more.

### Belle
Another old madame! She's so small I'm always so shocked by how small she is like she's
just a little black mass outside LT27 area. Gives off huge batman vibes. Wouldn't dare to touch her.

### Fred
Fred!!!!!!!! FREDDDDD!!!!!! What a sweet boy omg how can you not fall in love with this boy 
he looks so kind and loving!!!!!!!
